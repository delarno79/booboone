USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Write a comprehensive, engaging, SEO-optimised blog post targeting the keyword: "{keyword}".

Requirements:
- 900-1400 words.
- Natural, human tone. Write like an experienced human writer, not an AI.
- Use the keyword and closely related terms naturally (no stuffing).
- Well structured with an intro, multiple <h2> sections, <h3> sub-points where useful, short paragraphs, and at least one <ul> bullet list.

CRITICAL - avoid these AI giveaways:
- Do NOT include a section headed "Conclusion", "In Conclusion", "Final Thoughts",
  "Summary", "Wrapping Up", "Closing Thoughts", or anything similar. The article must
  simply END on a substantive, useful section - no summarising sign-off heading.
- Do NOT open with clichés like "In today's fast-paced world", "In the ever-evolving
  landscape of", "Whether you're a beginner or", or "Let's dive in".
- Do NOT use phrases like "In conclusion", "To sum up", "At the end of the day",
  "It's important to note that", or "When it comes to".
- Do NOT over-use em dashes or begin sentences with "Moreover", "Furthermore",
  "Additionally".
- Vary sentence length. Be specific and concrete: use real examples, numbers, and
  practical detail rather than generic advice.

Return ONLY a JSON object with exactly these fields:
{{
  "title": "An engaging, click-worthy H1 title (do NOT include the word 'title')",
  "meta_description": "A 150-160 character SEO meta description",
  "content_html": "The full article body as clean HTML using <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <strong>. Do NOT include <html>, <head>, <body>, or an <h1> tag.",
  "image_prompt": "A vivid, concrete prompt (max 40 words) for a photorealistic editorial featured image that fits the article. IMPORTANT: describe a scene with NO readable text in it - avoid computer/phone screens, documents, papers, charts, books, signage, labels, or whiteboards, because AI renders text as gibberish. Prefer people, hands, objects, places, nature, or close-up details instead."
